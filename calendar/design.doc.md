# TCP Calendar

## Overview

This is a simple calendar application that allows users do things with events.
The application is built using the TCP protocol.

The key is to demonstrate learning of TCP and socket programming, 
and simple protocol design.

The construction of the protocol should center around the following:
- Simple, easy to understand, easy to implement
- Minimalize the payload size over network. Do not send unnecessary data.

Consists of three main components:
- Client
- Server
- Database

## Client

**Disclaimer**: 
We assume the user is an *intelligent* human being with the ability 
    to NOT break the application in every possible way.
Therefore, the error handling is minimal.
All user input is valid, and will result in valid action. 
It's just a matter of "doing what the user REALLY thinks they want to do".
