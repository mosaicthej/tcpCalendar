<p> This is an individual assignment.
  
<P> <b>Part A: Physical Layer and Data Link Layer Properties </b> (20 marks).

<p>
For all questions in Part A, show your work, so part marks can be
given for correct reasoning, but faulty mathematical execution.

<ol>
<li><p>
<i>(4 marks)</i> Consider two nodes connected by a single dedicated link
within an OCN (on-chip network), SAN (system/storage area network),
LAN (local area network), or WAN (wide-area network), and suppose that
we wish to transmit a single 100 byte (including header) packet from
one node to the other. Calculate the <b>total delay</b> and
the <b>percentage of delay which is propagation delay</b> for each network,
assuming the following:
<ul>
<li>
the link data rate is 6 Gbps;</li>
<li>
there is no queueing delay;</li>
<li>
 the total node processing delay (not overlapped with any other
  component of delay) is x + (0.8 nanoseconds/byte), where x (the
  portion of this delay that is independent of packet size) is 0
  microseconds for the OCN, 0.6 microseconds for the SAN, 6
  microseconds for the LAN, and 60 microseconds for the WAN; and </li>
<li>
the link distances are 0.5 cm, 5m, 5000m, and 5000 km, for the OCN,
SAN, LAN, and WAN, respectively, with the speed of signal propagation
in each case equal to 200,000 km/s (approximately 2/3 of the speed of
light in a vacuum). </li>
</ul>

<li><p>
<i>(4 marks)</i>
<ul>
<li>
What is the minimum bandwidth needed to achieve a data rate
of <i>B</i> bits/sec if the signal is transmitted using NRZ, MLT-3,
and Manchester encoding, respectively? Explain your answer. </li>
<li>
Ten signals, each requiring 4000 Hz, are multplexed onto a channel
using FDM. What is the minimum bandwidth required for the multiplexed
channel? Assume that the guard bands are 400 Hz wide. </li>
</ul>
<li><p>
<i>(4 marks)</i>
<ul>
<li>
Suppose that data is transmitted in blocks of 1000 bits. What is the
maximum error rate under which using an error detection and retransmission
mechanism (1 parity bit per block) is better than using Hamming code?
Assume that bit errors are independent of one another and no bit error
occurs during retransmission. </li>
<li>
A 3000-km-long T1 trunk is used to transmit 64-byte frames
using <i>Go-Back-N</i>. If the propagation speed is 6 &mu;sec/km, how
many bits should the sequence numbers be?
</li>
</ul>

<li><p>
<i>(4 marks)</i>
<ul>
<li>Frames of 1000 bits are sent over a 1-Mbps channel using a
geostationary satellite whose propagation time from the earth is 270
msec. Acknowlegdements are always piggybacked onto data frames. The
headers are very short. Three-bit sequence numbes are used. What is
the maximum achievable channel utilization for
<ul>
<li>stop-and-wait?
<li>Go-Back-N?
<li>Selective repeat?
</ul>
<li> a 100-km-long cable runs at the T1 data rate. The propagation
  speed in the cable is 2/3 the speed of light in a vacuum. How many
  bits fit in the cable?
</ul>

<li><p>
<i>(4 marks)</i>
 Consider a source and destination pair connected by a
network path of capacity 100 Mbps and an average round-trip time of 40
ms (measured from when the source transmits the first bit of a packet
until the destination's ack is received). Assume a packet size of 1000
bytes.
<ul>
<li type="a"> Give the maximum achievable data transfer rate in Mbps, assuming
use of the <i>stop-and-wait</i> reliable data transfer protocol, and that
the loss probability is negligibly small.
<li type="a"> Give the maximum achievable data transfer rate in Mbps, assuming
use of a sliding window reliable data transfer protocol with maximum
sender window sizes of 1, 10, and 100, and that the loss probability
is negligibly small.
</ul>
</ol>

<p> <b>Part B: Client-Server Socket Programming</b> (60 marks)
<p>
The objective of this part of the assignment is to remind you of the
  socket API, become familiar with TCP, and implement
  different strategies for server implementations.

<p>
The application you are to write is a calendar server, based on
TCP. The server should be capable of handling 
multiple connections at a time, and therefore must use some method of
parallel connection and processing at the server.

<p>
Correspondingly, you will need to write client applications that make
requests of the server. In order to have this work, you need to define
a protocol (i.e. define how messages are formatted and transmitted),
implement that protocol and then write the appropriate client and
server programs.

<p><b>Operations to support:</b>
<ol>
<li>Add a new calendar event.
<li>Remove a calendar event. 
<li>Update an existing calendar event. 
<li>Get the events for a specific time or time range. 
</ol>
<p>
There are no other requirements regarding the protocol, i.e., you are
free to decide the protocol details, e.g., the message structure and
content for the client/server communication.

<p><b>Client implementation</b>
<p>
The client is a simple program that takes several arguments and
contacts the server and prints the response received from the
server. The syntax for the client should be the following:
<ol>
<li type ="A">Adding an event: <tt>./mycal hostname port myname add
    date start-time end-time Event-title </tt>
<li type="A">Removing an event: <tt>./mycal hostname port myname
    remove date start-time </tt>
<li type="A">Updating an event: <tt>./mycal hostname port myname
    update date start-time end-time Event-Title </tt>
<li type="A">Getting an event 1: <tt>./mycal hostname port myname get
    date time </tt>
<li type="A">Getting an event 2: <tt>./mycal hostname port myname get
    date </tt>
<li type="A">Getall events: <tt>./mycal hostname port myname getall </tt>

</ol>

<p>
In all cases 'myname' is a string that identifies a user (e.g., login
name). In (A), you specify the date, the beginning and end time of the
event, and a single word identifying the type of event (e.g., exam,
doctor, trip, meeting, ...). You can assume that no event can go
beyond 2400 of the same day (i.e., every event has to be finished by
midnight at the latest). In (B), you specify the
date and the beginning time of an event. If successful the client will
receive an acknowledgment from the server. If the event does not
exist, the client will be notified by the server and the client
informs the user. In (C), you specify an event as in (A), however,
either the ending time or the event type has to be different (or
both). Again, the client will inform the user if the operation was
successful. In (D), the server returns the type of the event
requested, if the event does not exist, the client informs the
user. In (E), if only the date is specified, all events of
that day are returned. In (F), the client first asks the server how
many entries the calendar file has for the client 'myname' and if the
response is nonzero, the client requests each entry individually,
with 2 seconds delay between requests. Once all events have been
received, the client notifies the server of the end of the connection.


<p>
Further, the server's hostname and port number have to be passed to
the client as command line arguments. Ports 30001 to 40000 are
available for use.

<p><b>Server Implementation</b>

<p>
The server waits for requests from clients.  When a request is
received, the proper data should be returned via the specified protocol.

<p>The format of the data storage should be as simple as possible. A
  main memory data structure should be able to be used (use your list
  implementation from CMPT 332, where each user has their own
  list). Sort the lists on start-time of the event.   Lists should be
  deleted when the last item is removed. List
  implementations may be shared. If you didn't take CMPT 332 from me,
  it is possible that alternate arrangements can be made.

<p>You are required to provide three different server implementations:

<ul>
<li>
Approach Based on Select(): A single-threaded server is used,
  but the server can handle multiple clients (and open sockets) with
  the select() system call.

<li>  
Multi-Threaded Approach: Here, multiple threads are used
  to handle requests in parallel (i.e., each new request is handled by
  a newly created thread). Use Posix-threads to create new
threads.

<li>
Multi-Process server. Here, multiple processes are used
  to handle requests in parallel (i.e., each new request is handled by
  a newly created process). The parent forks a child for every
  request, and the child exits when the connection is finished.
</ul>

In ALL versions of the server, you must consider <b>race conditions</b> 
with multiple concurrent
connections. This will involve the use of some concurrency control
mechanism to control access to the "database" that holds the calendar
events. It may be possible for the same user to be connected
simultaneously, or for 2 new users to contact the server
simultaneously, so that access to the lists must be protected. Posix semaphores,
or implementation of a readers/writers protocol are options.
<p>
<b>BONUS 1:</b> If there is a conflict with another already stored event,
optionally the client will be notified by the server and the client
informs the user (e.g. "Conflict detected!").
<p>
<b>BONUS 2:</b> On every request to the server, remove all events for all
users if their end time is in the past. 

<p>
<b>FINAL NOTE:</b> All programming practises required for CMPT 332 must be
followed:
<ul>
<li>Check the return values from system calls
<li>Check the command-line parameters
<li>Compile with -Wall -pedantic
<li>Any more defensive programming measures that come to mind.
</ul>

<p>You will need 1 client (TCP) and 3 servers (select(),
  Posix-threads, Multi-process). Reuse as much code as possible.

<h3> Hand In Instructions</h3>
<p>

Create a directory for this assignment:
<ul>
  <li> Place in this directory your assignment including the following:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>N separate PDF documents named Question_n.pdf (where n is the
    number of the question). </li>
    <li>Source code, header files, and makefile to compile the various
    binary programs. </li>
    <li>GIT logs for your progress and proper version control
    practices.</li>
    <li>Protocol design document: <tt>protocol.design.txt</tt>.</li>
    <li>Client and server program design document: <tt>PartB.design.txt</tt>.</li>
    <li>Testing showing message transmission and reception, and proper database
	updates.</li>
  </ul>

  <li> Now you are ready to hand in your assignment. To do so you are
going to make a <span style="font-weight: bold;">tar</span> file, and
upload it to Blackboard's assignment hand-in. All files in the main
    directory of the tar file, no subdirectories.
A marking script will then untar the assignment. Please do not gzip
    the file. I've had problems with 
different students using different versions of the compression program
and it just takes too much TA time, or requires a more complicated
    script to extract the necessary files.</li>
  <li> That's it - you are done.</li>
</ul>
