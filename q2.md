## Q2 ( 4 )

What is the minimum bandwidth needed to achieve a data rate of `B bits/sec` 
if the signal is transmitted using 
 - NRZ,
 - MLT-3, and 
 - Manchester encoding, 
 respectively? Explain your answer.

### A2.1
use $w$ to represent `bandwidth` to avoid confusion
(since $B$ is used as the data rate (in bits/sec))

Nyquist:
 B = $2w log_2 V$ bits/sec
 w: bandwidth
 V: discrete levels

#### NRZ
binary -> 2 states: V=2

$$
\begin{align}
B &= 2w log_2 V \\
  &= 2w \times 1 \\
  &= 2w\\
w &= \frac{B}{2}
\end{align}
$$

minimum bandwidth needs to be $\frac{B}{2}$ Hz

#### MLT-3

Has three possible states => V=3

To encode any 1 bit (information is 1 or 0), 
    it could be one of three states (-1, 0, 1).

Hence, to encoding B bits (2^B of information), 
it would have (3^B) different encodings in MLT-3.

So B bits as the data would mean $\frac{3^B}{2^B}\times B$ information sent
    through physical layer, which, $log_2{3^B}=B\times log_2 3$ bits
$$
\begin{align}
& log_2 3 \times B &= 2w log_2 3 \\
& w &= \frac{B}{2}
\end{align}
$$

The minimum bandwidth needs to be $\frac{B}{2}$ Hz

#### Manchester

Has 50% coding effieiency (the other half is for clocking info)
Hence, to send B bits $=2^B$ information, requires an encoding of 2B bits of
    data sent through physical.

$$
\begin{align}
& 2\times B &= 2w log_2 2\\
&   w &= \frac{B}{log_2 2}\\
&   w &= B
\end{align}
$$

Hence, the minimum bandwidth needs to be $B$ Hz.

### A2.2 FDM
Ten signals, each requiring 4000 Hz, 
are multplexed onto a channel using FDM. 

What is the minimum bandwidth required for the multiplexed channel? 
Assume that the guard bands are 400 Hz wide.

#### FDM

Each chan-> 4 kHz, each guard-> 0.4 kHz

10 signals would need 9 guard bands.

$$
\begin{align}
10 \times 4 \text{ kHz} + 9 \times 0.4 \text{ kHz}\\
&=43.6 \text{ kHz}
\end{align}
$$

The minimum bandwidth for this multiplexed channel is 43.6 kHz.
